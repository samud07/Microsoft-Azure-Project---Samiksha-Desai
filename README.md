This Project includes Various Azure instances and Services, Azure Virtual Networks,
Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Portal, Azure VPN Gateway, Availability Zones,
Windows and Linux images, Storage Account etc.
In two different locations, two virtual networks have been created.Subnets were
subsequently established in each virtual network. Then, each subnet has two virtual
machines created in it. A website is Hosted in each Virtual Machine. One gateway
subnet is added to these virtual networks, and two virtual network gateways are then
created in designated areas. Subsequently these virtual networks connected
Bidirectionally with one another and established a VPN tunnel, So that it ensures the
Application’s traffic is private and remains on the Microsoft backbone. It will help in
establishing healthy communication between two different regional networks of this
Application.
